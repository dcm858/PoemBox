PoemBox - Incomplete - missing 2 other files:  Maxruby.rb and 2 others
=======

PoemBox involved actors moving as silhouettes according to numbered selections made by phone, each of which would initiate the playback of a recited poem via the phone, as associated silhouettes would move.  
I used an Asterisk voice script (Dialplan I wrote w canned voice from Asterisk system) with keypress commands to control the initiation of the playing of corresponding video clips. (The files played by a Jitter/Max file provided by my project partner).
I used the Maxruby.rb file to tie the Jitter patch to the Asterisk and phone.
